    An improvised recipe of sorts.<br><br>
    When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind: <br><br>
    Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.<br><br>
    Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.<br><br>
    Must use pine nuts. No food processing allowed.<br><br>
    These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.<br><br>
    Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity!<br><br>
    Or should it?<br>.<br><br>
    Become inspired by mediocre productions.<br><br>
    Don’t covert production and experimentation recipe <br><br>
    Always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves. <br><br>
    A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.<br><br>
    Take the knife to cultural icons and produce: <br><br>
    produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe. <br><br>.<br><br>
    </p>

    Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe;<br><br>
    pun and play,<br><br>
    annihilate<br><br>
    and resurrect meaning.<br><br>

    Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh. <br><br>
